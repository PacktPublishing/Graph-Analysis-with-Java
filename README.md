## About the Video Course
Graph analysis helps you track relationships between data points to identify associations, clusters, and patterns. This video course will begin by understanding how to track data in graph form so that you can take advantage of these techniques and understand the various graph database components. You will also learn how to make a basic graph and view, interact with your graphs, and perform analysis like cluster detection and statistical calculations. Towards the end of the video course, you will walk through a real-world graph analysis problem using Java to read your email communications and graph them for cluster detection.
